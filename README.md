# SpaceX-Falcon-9-first-stage-Landing-Prediction
In this project, we will use machine learning to determine if the first stage of Falcon 9 will land successfully. We will split the data into training data and test data to find the best Hyperparameter for SVM, Classification Trees, and Logistic Regression. Then find the method that performs best using test data.
